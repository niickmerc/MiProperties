## **Property Management Application** (CPSC210 Project)

My personal project idea for CPSC210 is focused on the world of residential and commercial property 
management. I designed this project to help a variety of different user groups manage the complexities 
that often accompany real estate investment and management.

## Who Could Use This App?
There are two main user groups that may benefit from using my application:

1. Professional Landlords 
2. Property Management Companies / Managers

## User Stories for Project Phase #1

### Completed User Stories
- **User Story #1** - As a user, I want to be able to add a new property to my portfolio.
- **User Story #2** - As a user, I want to be able to remove an existing property from my portfolio.
- **User Story #3** - As a user, I want to be able to view all properties in my portfolio.
- **User Story #4** - As a user, I want to be able to select a specific property and view / edit it.
- **User Story #5** - As a user, I want to be able to assign one or more tenants to a specific property.
- **User Story #6** - As a user, I want to be able to remove one or more tenants from a specific property.
- **User Story #7** - As a user, I want to be able to review some summary statistics on my portfolio as a whole.
- **User Story #8** - As a user, I want to be able to save my portfolio to file prior to exiting the application.
- **User Story #9** - As a user, I want to be able to load my current portfolio from the application main menu.

### Things to Implement in the Future
- Ability to add more detailed tenant information (Employment Info, Annual Salary, Etc)
- Some kind of rental portal for landlords and tenants to request / receive funds
- More detailed property fields (Insurance reminders, maintenance fee tracker, etc)
